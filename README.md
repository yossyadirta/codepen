# CodePen Projects

This repository is a collection of my **CodePen** projects. Here, I showcase various front-end experiments and animations built using technologies like **GSAP**, **THREE.JS**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. Feel free to explore the different projects below.

## Projects

### 1. [Explore Rinjani](rinjani-parallax)  
   **Description**:  
   A GSAP-powered **scroll animation experience** that brings the beautiful **Mount Rinjani** to life with dynamic parallax effects. The animation reacts to the scroll position, changing the scale and opacity of the images, creating a 3D-like effect.

   **Live Demo**: [Explore Rinjani on CodePen](https://codepen.io/yossyadirta/pen/RNbZKjd)

   **Folder**: [rinjani-parallax](rinjani-parallax)
