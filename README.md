This repository is a collection of my **CodePen** projects. Here, I showcase various front-end experiments and animations built using technologies like **GSAP**, **THREE.JS**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. Feel free to explore the different projects below.

  <summary><strong>1. Explore Rinjani</strong></summary>
  
  **Description**:  
  A GSAP-powered **scroll animation experience** that brings the beautiful **Mount Rinjani** to life with dynamic parallax effects. The animation reacts to the scroll position, changing the scale and opacity of the images, creating a 3D-like effect.
  
  **Preview**:
